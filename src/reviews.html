        “ZeroMax was a great company to go with while moving during the coronavirus pandemic. They were gloves and masks
        throughout the entire move. The 3 movers wrapped each individual piece of furniture securely and ensured it would
        not be damaged. They even disassembled a few small pieces of furniture for us. They were very thorough and careful
        when loading and unloading the truck, and put every item in the correct rooms as instructed. I would recommend!”

        “I highly recommend ZeroMax Movers. I received a quote fast and booking was easy ($50 deposit to confirm). They
        answered any questions I had and helped provided COI for my new building. They also call the day before to confirm
        and check the moving list. Like other reviewers, the pricing was fair and not outrageous. I had the earliest move
        in time and our movers even showed up a few minutes before the appointment time. We had two movers that were fast
        and efficient. From our one bedroom apartment with three flights of stairs plus a courtyard with a stoop to our
        new apartment with two flights of stairs took a total of 3.5 hrs (distance between apartments was 7min drive).
        They carefully wrapped our furniture and disassembled and reassembled our queen bed quickly. Wardrobe boxes are
        complimentary. If we have to ever move again, we would definietly go back to them.”

        “These guys are amazing. I honestly will never call another moving company and will recommend them to everyone I
        know. They were so accommodating. They moved us out of the old place on Saturday, held our stuff overnight as I
        had issues to attend to and I delayed them so the unloading was done on Sunday! Also, they didn't charge us a
        thing to hold our stuff overnight! They were on time both days, they were very courteous and respectful with our
        things, and we enjoyed talking to them. They were not in a rush but were very quick with the move. I love these
        guys! Seriously, these guys can't be beat. One last thing. They provide the truck too. I didn't have to rent a
        truck and then hire movers, they are a package deal”

        “These guys were great! I had a fairly easy move (1BR, one person) and I had moved a lot myself prior to the move,
        after my initial quote. Ron adjusted the price by what I considered a very fair amount. I had two friendly movers
        who hustled and made me feel like they were interested in getting things done in a timely manner, which they
        certainly did. They also asked me where I wanted things when they carried them in instead of just dumping them (I
        live alone, so this was very much appreciated). I only have good things to say and have already recommended them
        to a friend of mine who's moving end of month. Impressed!”

        “I had never heard of Zeromax Movers and decided to use them mostly because they got back to me quickly with a
        quote on Thumbtack and it was very reasonable. After a few communications with them to iron out the details of the
        move, I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best on moving day. They arrived on time, were courteous and
        professional, and did an excellent job handling the move. I was relieved and impressed. Plus, there were no hidden
        charges in the final cost (communicating beforehand and making sure everyone is on the same page is key). I would
        use them again in a second and recommend them highly–great experience overall.”
