      <h3>are indisputable arguments in favor of choosing our residential moving company and a guarantee that your
        relocation won’t bring you losses, worries, and disappointments.</h3>

      <p>
        Our pros will cope with work of any complexity. Do not be mistaken and think that the task of the movers is only
        to take the furniture out of the room, load it into the truck, and lift it to the floor upon arrival at the
        destination point. Experienced NYC residential movers from our company provide a much wider range of services,
        in fact, completely taking on all the hassle of arranging and conducting the residential move.

            You can easily check if your movers are licensed and insured. This information should be available on
            the movers’ website https://zeromaxmoving.com/, advertising materials and trucks. Whenever you call a
            mover, you can ask them for their DOT and MC license numbers and then verify them with the Department
            of Transportation and the local authority. If they are licensed, by law they have to offer limited
            liability protection. Some movers offer additional coverage as well or can refer to agents they work
            with if you need full coverage for your belongings. For more information you can call us at
            (929)-295-6262.
