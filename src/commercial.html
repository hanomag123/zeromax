  <h2 class="temp-title">A few essential commercial moving <span class="text-blue">preparatory steps</span> are</h2>

  <ol class="temp-list">
    <li>
      Carefully consider the number of items in your company office that need to be moved. Get rid of the stuff you think you will not need anymore.
    </li>
    <li>
      Be sure to find and hire commercial movers in NYC with specialists that provide quality wrap and pack service. Well-made packing and marking is a safekeeping guarantee for all your items.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use the quote to arrange and prepare the moving funds allocation. This is understandable that any office movers can't predict the exact amount, but you can consider all possible expenses to maximally avoid unpleasant final bill surprises. Typically, the commercial moving cost of any business is based on the distance, weight, volume of belongings, and the type of office relocation services ordered.

            You can easily check if your movers are licensed and insured. This information should be available on
            the movers’ website https://zeromaxmoving.com/, advertising materials and trucks. Whenever you call a
            mover, you can ask them for their DOT and MC license numbers and then verify them with the Department
            of Transportation and the local authority. If they are licensed, by law they have to offer limited
            liability protection. Some movers offer additional coverage as well or can refer to agents they work
            with if you need full coverage for your belongings. For more information you can call us at
            (929)-295-6262.
