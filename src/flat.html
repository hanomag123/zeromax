  <div class="temp-content">
    <p>
      Professional flat rate movers NYC typically use the general calculation that includes an in-home estimation. This
      means that expert flat fee movers will come to your house to estimate your possessions and determine the volume
      and value of the property you wish to relocate. Distance, dates, and other aspects will also be considered. Once
      all the data is collected and recorded, the estimator will be able to provide you with a standard price. Being
      aware of it ahead of time ensures that the amount you must pay at the end does not surpass that pricing.
